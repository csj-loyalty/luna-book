## Visualizations in Luna

Visualization in Luna is a widget responsible for displaying data in certain way in Node Editor. In Luna Studio we have few types of visualizations available for different types of data, i.e. echarts plots for lists.
To show the visualziation you have to click the eye icon on the right side of node name:
![](/assets/visualizations_eye_icon.png)
To choose the different type of visualization you can drop a list of possible to use types of visualizations.

## Creating custom visualizations

To create custom visualization for your project you need to add visualizers folder in the root of the project folder:
```
MyProject/
    MyProject.lunaproject
    src/
        Main.luna
    visualizers/
        example/
            config.js
            example.css
            example.html
            example.js            
```
It contains few files:
    * `config.js` - module responsible for checking if your visualization is able to present data of current type and presenting to gui all compatible presentation forms
    * `example.js` - event listeners for different events (like `message`, `resize` and `load`). All the important things will happen here.
    * `example.css` - css styling for visualizer
    * `example.html` - html file with all css and js imports.

You can download template `visualizers` folder from https://github.com/luna/visualizers-template/archive/master.zip
At this moment you can not change the size of the visualization, it is fixed to `300 x 300 px`. If you hold `space` key the visualization will be maximized to the Node Editor size.


Communication between Luna and visualization is through JSON structures. Simplest way to create custom visualization, on Luna side, is creating proper type for a visualization. Let's assume we want to connect with a new plotting library written in JS. The JS part of visualization is expecting id of html object in which it will show the result and plot definition. The chart object will contain two nested objects: data series called `data` and `type` with type of plot. The datatype looks like:
```
class PlotType:
    Bar
    Pie
    Scatter

class DataSeries:
    data:: List Int
    type:: PlotType
```
Data series can be an Int list and the plot type can be `Scatter` , `Pie` or `Bar`. I will create separate type called `PlotType`. Additional helpers for `DataSeries` are defined to make creating JSON more simple and straightforward. To use it in JS we need to define `toJSON` method on each of the classes.
```
class PlotType:
    Bar
    Pie
    Scatter

    def toJSON: case self of
        Bar:     JSONString "bar"
        Pie:     JSONString "pie"
        Scatter: JSONString "scatter"

class DataSeries:
    DataSeries
    DataSeriesVal:
        data:: List Int
        type:: PlotType

    def getData: case self of
        DataSeriesVal data _: data
    def getType: case self of
        DataSeriesVal _ type: type

    def toJSON:
        JSON.empty . insert "data" self.getData . insert "type" self.getType
```
As you can see I don't have to define `toJSON` method for `List Int` separately. It is predefined in a `List` class in Luna.Base.
Plot will be a simple list of `DataSeries`, so the class for final type to plot with `toJSON` method is:
```
class Plot:
    Plot
    PlotVal (List DataSeries)
    def toJSON: case self of
        PlotVal ds: ds.toJSON
```

To read the data in JS in `example.js` file you need to unpack the JSON:
```
  window.addEventListener("message", function (evt) {
    if(evt.data.data) {
        data = JSON.parse(evt.data.data);
        dataToPlot = data;
        ExamplePlottingLibrary.plotCommand("example_div", dataToPlot)
    };
    }
```
If you want the visualization behave in certain way on "resize" or "load" message you can define it in the same file in proper event listeners (look at the template - https://github.com/luna/visualizers-template/blob/master/example/example.js).

To set on which type visualization should be shown we need to add a constructor to constructors list in `config.js` file:
```
module.exports = function (type) {
    var examplePattern =
        { constructor: ["List"], fields: [{constructor: ["Int", "Real"], fields: { any: true }}]
        };

    if (cfgHelper.matchesType(type, examplePattern))
        {
            return [{name: "example", path: "example.html"}]
        }
    else
        return [];
};
```
If a node will have `Plot` type the `example` visualization will be shown in drop-down menu on the left side of the node.

To use such defined visualization in your project you need to define the list of Int which will be your data:
![](/assets/visualizations_list.png)
and a new node packing it in the `DataSeries` type:
![](/assets/visualizations_dataseries.png)
and then into `Plot` type with single element list contains your data:
![](/assets/visualizations_plot.png)

And voila! you can see your plot in Node Editor!
